To run this project locally, you need to have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.dev/) version 14 or higher and [npm](https://npmjs.com/) installed on your machine.

After you clone the repository and navigate into the project's folder, let's get the necessary packages installed by running:

```
npm install
```

To make sure everything is set up correctly, run:

```
npm run setup
